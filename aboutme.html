            <p>
                I'm so glad you have decided to explore my website. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a computer science major at Stevens Institute of Technology, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
                My passion is in data, and I hope that after college I can explore data engineering and data science.
                <br>
                <br>
                My journey into computer science began with my interest in tech when I was in middle school. I loved watching videos on how prosthetic limbs were made and it grew my 
                interests in what tech can do. I then began to take coding class in highschool in my sophmore year with AP computer science, and taking coding classes outside of school during my junior
                and senior year.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my time at Stevens I truely have grown so much and learned what it means to be a coder. I know I have so much more to learn but having the passion and to continue learning 
                and continuing to be consistant will help me become a great coder.

                <strong>Beyond Tech</strong> I love to pick up new hobbies. I enjoy reading, recently I've read "The 48 Laws of Power" and currently I'm reading "Your Next Five Moves".
                When I'm not reading I enjoy journaling, sewing, and crocheting. I love making vision boards to outline my goals for the year and being able to craft.
                Some of my favorite shows to watch are Abbot Elementary, The Office, and Bob's Burgers.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also love to be part of clubs. At school I part of the Society of Women Engineers, STEP, the computer science club, and the Muslim Student Assoication.
                I am also an America Needs You Alumni, and being part of the program allowed me to make lasting connections and gain valuable information about the coporate world.
