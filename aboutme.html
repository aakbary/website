                I'm so glad you have decided to explore my website. I am a computer science major at Stevens Institute of Technology, with an expected graduation in May 2025.
                My passion is in data, and I hope that after college I can explore data engineering and data science.

                My journey into computer science began with my interest in tech when I was in middle school. I loved watching videos on how prosthetic limbs were made and it grew my 
                interests in what tech can do. I the began to take coding class in highschool in my sophmore year with AP computer science, and taking outside coding classes during my junior
                and senior year.

                During my time at Stevens I truely have grown so much and learned what it means to be a coder. I know I have so much more to learn but having the passion and to continue learning
                and to be consistant to me makes a great coder.

                <strong>Beyond Tech</strong> I love to pick up new hobbies. I enjoy reading, recently I've read "The 48 Laws of Power" and currently I'm reading "Your Next Five Moves".
                When I'm not reading I enjoy journaling, sewing, and crocheting. I also love to be part of clubs. At school I part of the Society of Women Engineers, STEP, the computer science club, and the Muslim Student Assoication.
                I am also an America Needs You Alumni, and being part of the program allowed me to make lasting connections and gain valuable information about the coporate world.
